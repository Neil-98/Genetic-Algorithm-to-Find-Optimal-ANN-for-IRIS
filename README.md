# Genetic-Algorithm-to-Find-Optimal-ANN-for-IRIS
Contains python code for a simple genetic algorithm which selects the best neural network architecture, given certain constraints, for classification of IRIS dataset.

Based on this code https://github.com/luaffjk/ga-mlp/blob/master/ga-mlp.py explained by the author in this article https://medium.com/analytics-vidhya/a-genetic-algorithm-for-optimizing-neural-network-parameters-d8187d5114ed
Key difference is that a Keras based implementation of ANN is used instead of MLP_Classifier.
